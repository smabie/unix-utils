LAMBDA(1)		   OpenBSD Reference Manual		     LAMBDA(1)

NAME
     lambda - create a shell script and print its path

SYNOPSIS
     lambda [-i interpreter] expression ...

DESCRIPTION
     The lambda utility creates and then prints the path to a shell script
     containing the expressions passed to it. Each expression corresponds to a
     line of the shell script. The purpose of this is to crudely simulate
     lambda expressions or anonymous functions that are present in many
     programming languages.

     The options are as follows:

     -i interpreter
	     The path to the command interpreter to be used. Defaults to
	     ``/bin/sh''.

FILES
     /bin/sh		default command interpreter
     /tmp/lambda-cache	location of the files created by lambda

EXIT STATUS
     The lambda utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     To create an anonymous function that prints out its second argument on
     the first line and its first argument on the second line:

	   $ lambda 'echo $2' 'echo $1'

     Calling lambda just by itself is not very useful. To create the same
     function and apply it to two arguments ``foo'' and ``bar'':

	   $ `lambda 'echo $2' 'echo $1'` foo bar

     A more practical example, and probably the most common use case of lambda
     is in conjunction with xargs(1).  To print the name and length of the
     name of every file in the current directory:

	   $ ls | xargs -n 1 `lambda 'echo $1 $(($(echo $1 | wc -c)-1))'`

SEE ALSO
     apply(1), xargs(1)
