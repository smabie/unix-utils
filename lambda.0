     The llaammbbddaa utility creates and then prints the path to a shell script
     containing the expressions passed to it. Each _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n corresponds to a
     line of the shell script. The purpose of this is to crudely simulate
     lambda expressions or anonymous functions that are present in many
     programming languages.

     The options are as follows:

     --ii _i_n_t_e_r_p_r_e_t_e_r
             The path to the command interpreter to be used. Defaults to
             ``/bin/sh''.

FFIILLEESS
     _/_b_i_n_/_s_h            default command interpreter
     _/_t_m_p_/_l_a_m_b_d_a_-_c_a_c_h_e  location of the files created by llaammbbddaa

     The llaammbbddaa utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
     To create an anonymous function that prints out its second argument on
     the first line and its first argument on the second line:

           $ lambda 'echo $2' 'echo $1'

     Calling llaammbbddaa just by itself is not very useful. To create the same
     function and apply it to two arguments ``foo'' and ``bar'':

           $ `lambda 'echo $2' 'echo $1'` foo bar

     A more practical example, and probably the most common use case of llaammbbddaa
     is in conjunction with xargs(1).  To print the name and length of the
     name of every file in the current directory:

           $ ls | xargs -n 1 `lambda 'echo $1 $(($(echo $1 | wc -c)-1))'`

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
     apply(1), xargs(1)

     This program was created by Sturm Mabie (_s_t_u_r_m_@_c_r_y_p_t_m_._o_r_g).
