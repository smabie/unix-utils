     sslliiccee - display portions of files

     sslliiccee [--bb | --ll | --ww] _r_a_n_g_e [_f_i_l_e _._._.]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The sslliiccee utility displays a portion of each _f_i_l_e, as specified by _r_a_n_g_e.
     If no files are provided, sslliiccee reads from standard input. If more than
     one file is specified, sslliiccee precedes the output of each file with the
     following, in order to delimit the displayed sections of each file:

           ==> _f_i_l_e <==

     The specific identifying syntax was chosen to reflect that of head(1) and
     tail(1).

     The options are as follows:

     --bb      Specifies that _r_a_n_g_e should operate on the bytes of each file.

     --ll      Indicates that _r_a_n_g_e refers to lines of each file. This is the
             default.

     --ww      Binds _r_a_n_g_e to operate on words of each file.

     _r_a_n_g_e   Indicates what portion of each file to be displayed.  _r_a_n_g_e must
             be either two positive integers separated by nothing but a dash
             `-' or a single positive integer.

     The sslliiccee utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
