NAME
     slice - display portions of files

SYNOPSIS
     slice [-b | -l | -w] range [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The slice utility displays a portion of each file, as specified by range.
     If no files are provided, slice reads from standard input. If more than
     one file is specified, slice precedes the output of each file with the
     following, in order to delimit the displayed sections of each file:

	   ==> file <==

     The specific identifying syntax was chosen to reflect that of head(1) and
     tail(1).

     The options are as follows:

     -b	     Specifies that range should operate on the bytes of each file.

     -l	     Indicates that range refers to lines of each file. This is the
	     default.

     -w	     Binds range to operate on words of each file.

     range   Indicates what portion of each file to be displayed.  range must
	     be either two positive integers separated by nothing but a dash
	     `-' or a single positive integer.

EXIT STATUS
     The slice utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
