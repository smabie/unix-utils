NAME
     pick - interactively select lines from files

SYNOPSIS
     pick [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The pick utility reads in lines from each file, and prints each line out
     one by one to standard error, querying the user after each line is
     displayed. If no files are specified, pick reads from standard input. If
     the user enters any string starting with the letter `y', the line is then
     copied to standard output, if any string starting with the letter `q' is
     entered, the rest of the file is skipped. Otherwise, pick moves on to the
     next line.

EXIT STATUS
     The pick utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
