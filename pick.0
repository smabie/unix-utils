DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The ppiicckk utility reads in lines from each _f_i_l_e, and prints each line out
     one by one to standard error, querying the user after each line is
     displayed. If no files are specified, ppiicckk reads from standard input. If
     the user enters any string starting with the letter `y', the line is then
     copied to standard output, if any string starting with the letter `q' is
     entered, the rest of the file is skipped. Otherwise, ppiicckk moves on to the
     next line.

EEXXIITT SSTTAATTUUSS
     The ppiicckk utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
