BTEE(1)			   OpenBSD Reference Manual		       BTEE(1)

NAME
     btee - buffered pipe fitting

SYNOPSIS
     btee [-ai] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The btee utility copies standard input to standard output, making a copy
     in zero or more files. The output is buffered. Except for the output
     being buffered, btee is in every way identical to tee(1).

     The options are as follows:

     -a	     Append the output to the files rather than overwriting them.

     -i	     Ignore the SIGINT signal.

EXIT STATUS
     The btee utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
